Created OUs for key departments: IT, HR, Sales, and Finance.

Created Security Groups (e.g., IT-SG, HR-SG, Sales-SG, Finance-SG) to manage access control.

Added ~20 users and assigned them to their corresponding OUs and groups.

Goal: apply group-based permissions and simulate a company-style structure.
